## Exercise 2 - Making some tests pass

Navigate to this directory in your terminal (`exercise-210-arrays`). 

Install the dependencies: 

```
yarn
```

Now start the tests running with: 

```
yarn start
```

(or `yarn start:windows` if you are using git bash in Windows, [see here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63938553/15812488))


Refer to the documentation here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array to see how the various array methods work. 

Implement the functions such that the tests work.
