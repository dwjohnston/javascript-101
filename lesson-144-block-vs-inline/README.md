# Block vs Inline

HTML Elements originally had two* main ways content is displayed, - block and inline. 

*Actually, there are more, but I'm ignore table display for this exercise. 

You may have already noticed the difference in behavior. Content like a `<div>` or a `<p>` always creates a _box_ of content, they never sit side by side. Whereas content like a `<span>` and an `<input>`. Will naturally sit side by side. Additionaly `<span>`s will wrap - meaning their content is not always rectangular.
