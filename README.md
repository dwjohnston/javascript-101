## Note for Windows users

If you are a Windows user, we assume that you are using [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) as your terminal to run all exercises. 

These exercises will have you run `yarn start:windows` instead of `yarn:start`. The reason for this is an issue with how Jest works on Windows, [see this Stack Overflow question and answer here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63938553/15812488). 

If you have any trouble running any exercises, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/dwjohnston/javascript-101/issues) on the github.
