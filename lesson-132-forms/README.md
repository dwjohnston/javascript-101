# Forms

In lesson-130 we introduced HTML. With the HTML we introduce there, you could _display_ information, for example, you create a recipe website, or a blog. However, there isn't any way for the user to _interact_ with the website, except for clicking links. 

In this lesson, we are going to introduce _forms_ which allow the user to enter information. 

## The <form> element

The `<form>` element tells the browser that everything contained within belongs to a single form. 

A webpage can have multiple forms. 


## Form elements

### text

The text input allows the user to enter text. 

### checkboxes

Checkboxes allow users to select _one or many_, from a list of options. 

### radio button 

Radio buttons allow the user to select _one_ from a list of options. 

The reason it is called a radio button is because it's based on those old push/pop buttons on car radios, where you push one and the others pop out. 



### select

Functionally, a select achives the same purpose as a radio button list, it allows the user to select one of a list of options. 

### text-like inputs

There are other inputs that look the same as a 

### submit 

The submit input is a special input that will tell the browser to submit the form. 


### Label

Labels allow labelling a form control. Note that when you click a label, it acts as if you clicked the form control!
